Title: Linear algebra and the Buckingham Pi theorem

We previously spent [two](introduction-to-dimensional-analysis.html)
[longish](nondimensional-numbers-and-the-buckingham-pi-theorem.html)
posts on motivating, and then semi-quantitatively describing the Buckingham Pi theorem.
Here we will try to describe the theorem more precisely and more generally, and the tool
will be linear algebra. As is always the case with mathematics a more
precise and general solution is going to be more abstract. But bear with me,
hopefully it will not be too bad.
