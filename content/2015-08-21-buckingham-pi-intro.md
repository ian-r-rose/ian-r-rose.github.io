Title: Introduction

Welcome to the inaugural post of this blog, where I plan to write about anything that strikes me as interesting. 
For the most part these things will be related to geology, geophysics, or scientific computing.
At the moment I am titling the site "Geomusings," with which I am not necessarily in love, but I could 
not think of something better when setting things up.

Overall it is my hope that this blog will accomplish these three things, in no particular order:

* Get me to write more often and with less friction.
* Provide a place to record various ideas, derivations, and perspectives so that I can refer to them later.
* Maybe even be of some interest to some third party (though this may not ever be the case. If so, hello!).

To start, I plan to write a series of posts on one of my favorite results in mathematical physics:
the Buckingham Pi theorem.
