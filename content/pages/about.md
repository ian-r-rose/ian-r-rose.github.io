Title: About me
Slug: about

I am a graduate student in geophysics at UC Berkeley. 
This blog is meant to be a place to write down various musings that
I have about Earth and planetary science, geology, applied mathematics, 
scientific computing, and whatever else strikes me as interesting.

My primary resesarch interests lie in the dynamics of planetary mantles,
which I study through a combination of numerical and analytical techniques.
I am also interested in the thermal evolution of planets, fluid dynamics, 
computational mineral physics, and numerical methods for scientific computing

[Here](/interactive_earth/index.html) is an educational application that I wrote 
for learning about the physics of convection, earthquakes and mantle dynamics.

I am a contributor to the open-source mantle convection software [ASPECT](http://aspect.dealii.org/).

I am one of the developers of the mantle mineral physics toolkit [Burnman](https://github.com/geodynamics/burnman).
