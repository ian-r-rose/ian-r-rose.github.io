Title: Ian Rose
Slug: about

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/),
where I am a core developer on [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org),
working on [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

I was previously a graduate student in geophysics at UC Berkeley..
This blog is meant to be a place to write down various musings that
I have about planetary science, geology, applied mathematics, 
scientific computing, and whatever else strikes me as interesting.

[Here](/interactive_earth/index.html) is an educational application that I wrote 
for learning about the physics of convection, earthquakes and mantle dynamics.

I have been a contributor to the open-source mantle convection software [ASPECT](http://aspect.dealii.org/).

I am one of the developers of the mantle mineral physics toolkit [Burnman](https://github.com/geodynamics/burnman).
