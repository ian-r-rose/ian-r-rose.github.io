      <p>This simulation should be quite portable across many different browsers and operating systems. That being said, it is difficult to test all the possible combinations.  I have known it to work on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, running Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. </p>
      <p>It uses WebGL for rendering, which is a fairly new web technology. If you have difficulty starting it, it may be due to WebGL being disabled on your browswer (usually you can enable it by going into the advanced settings somewhere).</p>
      <p>Finally, it is quite computationally intensive, and some slower computers may have a difficult time running it.  If that is the case, you might try running the lower resolution versions.</p>
      <p>If you have a problem that is not addressed here, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub page for this project <a href="https://github.com/ian-r-rose/interactive_earth">here</a></p>
