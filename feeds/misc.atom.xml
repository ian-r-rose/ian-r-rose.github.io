For the most part these things will be related to geology, geophysics, or scientific computing.
At the moment I am titling the site "Geomusings," with which I am not necessarily in love, but I could 
not think of something better when setting things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it is my hope that this blog will accomplish these three things, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get me to write more often and with less friction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a place to record various ideas, derivations, and perspectives so that I can refer to them later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe even be of some interest to some third party (though this may not ever be the case. If so, hello!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I plan to write a series of posts on one of my favorite results in mathematical physics:
the Buckingham Pi theorem.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
