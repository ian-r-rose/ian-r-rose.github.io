  <div class="article">
    <p><img alt="6-bunch" src="articles/transit/images/6-bunch.jpg" title="Bunching on the 6 bus line in Oakland"></p>
<p>This is the second and final part of a short series of articles
on constructing a mathematical model for why buses always seem to travel in packs
(known as bus bunching).</p>
<p>In the <a href="bus-bunching-1.html">previous article</a>
we set up the model, consisting of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> buses traveling on a loop,
where we parameterized the position of the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th bus by <span class="math">\(\theta_n\)</span>.
We presumed that a bus is slowed down by the boarding of passengers,
and that more passengers will need to board if it has been longer
since the last bus came along, an effect given by a parameter <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>The equations for this model are given by
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d\theta_n}{d t} = 
 v_0 \left[ 1 - \gamma (\theta_{n+1} - \theta_n) \right]
\label{evolution}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>We furthermore showed that the equilibrium configuration for a set of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> buses
is for them to be equally spaced along the route, traveling at a velocity of <span class="math">\(v_e\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
v_e = v_0 \left[ 1 - \frac{2 \pi \gamma}{N} \right]
\label{equilibrium}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>In system with five buses, and in reference frame traveling at a velocity of <span class="math">\(v_e\)</span>,
this equilibrium solution looks like this:</p>
<iframe src=/visualization/bus/bus-bunching.html?interactive=false&equilibrium=true&boost=true&gamma=0.15&n=5 width=700 height=700></iframe>

<p>In this article we will demonstrating that this equilibrium solution is not stable,
and that it will inevitably result in the buses bunching.</p>
<h2>Stability analysis</h2>
<p>Most stability analyses are centered on answering a central question:
is my equilibrium solution stable with respect to small perturbations?
That is to say, if I have an equilibrium solution and poke it slightly,
does it return to equilibrium, or does that poke keep growing until the solution
is no longer anything like the equilibrium one?
<img alt="stability" src="articles/transit/images/stability.png" title="Illustration of stability">
This behavior can be visualized by thinking of a ball balanced on a hill,
and another resting in a trough.
Both of the balls are not moving around, and are thus in equilibrium solutions.
However, if I nudge the ball on the hill, it will continue rolling until it is far from the peak.
If I nudge the ball in the trough, it will roll back to the middle and
eventually come to a rest.
The first situation is an unstable equilibrium, and the second is a stable one.</p>
<p>Our approach for analyzing the system of equations in equation \eqref{evolution} will be similar:
we will investigate its behavior when we nudge it slightly away from the equilibrium solution
represented by equation \eqref{equilibrium}.
If those nudges grow in time, it is unstable.
If they die off in time, it is stable.</p>
<h2>Perturbation equations</h2>
<p>The first step in deriving the perturbation equations is to split the
bus positions <span class="math">\(\theta_n(t)\)</span> into two parts, an equilibrium part and a perturbation:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\theta_n = \theta^e_n + \theta^\prime_n
\label{decompose}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>In equation \eqref{decompose}, <span class="math">\(\theta^e_n\)</span> is the equilibrium solution for the buses
(i.e. <span class="math">\(v_e\)</span> integrated with respect to time),
and <span class="math">\(\theta^\prime_n\)</span> is a small perturbation away from that equilibrium.
You may wonder what the perturbation actually <em>is</em>, since it can be a function of time,
and each of the buses can have a different perturbation.
Fortunately, we will be able to show that this analysis does not depend on the form
of the perturbation (other than that it is nonzero), so it can be completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>The governing equations are in terms of velocities rather than positions,
so we take the time derivative of equation \eqref{decompose},
noting that <span class="math">\(d \theta^e_n / dt = v^e\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d \theta_n}{dt} = \frac{d \theta^e_n}{dt} + \frac{d \theta^\prime_n}{dt} = v_e + \frac{d \theta^\prime_n}{dt}
\label{decompose2}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>We can substitute equations \eqref{decompose} and \eqref{decompose2}
into equation \eqref{evolution} to get
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d \theta^\prime_n}{dt} + v_e = 
v_0 \left[ 1 - \gamma (\theta^e_{n+1} - \theta^e_n) - \gamma(\theta^\prime_{n+1} - \theta^\prime_n) \right]
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
Note that in the equilibrium configuration the buses are equally spaced,
so <span class="math">\(\theta^e_{n+1} - \theta^e_{n} = 2 \pi / N\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d \theta^\prime_n}{dt} + v_e = 
v_0 \left[ 1 - \frac{2 \pi \gamma}{N}  - \gamma(\theta^\prime_{n+1} - \theta^\prime_n) \right]
\end{equation}</div>
<p>This allows <span class="math">\(v_e\)</span> to be subtracted from both sides, leaving us with:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d \theta^\prime_n}{dt} = 
v_0 \gamma(\theta^\prime_{n} - \theta^\prime_{n+1})
\label{perturb}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>Okay, so what did those manipulations buy us?
There are two attractive features that equation \eqref{perturb} has:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is now a system of differential equations involving only the perturbations,
the time evolution of which we are interested in for the stability problem.
The equilibrium solution has completely disappeared.</li>
<li>More importantly, <em>it is now a system of linear equations!</em>
There are no nonlinearities or constant offsets getting in our way.
And if there is one thing mathematics is good at analyzing, it is linear equations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, since it is a set of linear equations,
we can write it using matrix notation:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d \Theta^\prime}{d t} = 
\mathbf{A}\Theta^\prime
\label{matrix}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime\)</span> is a vector containing all the perturbations to the <span class="math">\(N\)</span> buses,
and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is a matrix describing the linear coupling between the buses, given by:</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = 
v_0 \gamma 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\label{A}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
Note that the last row couples the speed of the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>th bus to the first bus,
reflecting the circular nature of the model.</p>
<h2>The eigendecomposition</h2>
<p>When analyzing a system of linear equations,
it is often helpful consider it in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors
(exactly how it is helpful should be clearer in a moment).
A general perturbation vector <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime\)</span> can be decomposed
into a linear combination of the <span class="math">\(N\)</span> eigenvectors of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>
(known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#Eigenspaces,_geometric_multiplicity,_and_the_eigenbasis_for_matrices">eigendecomposition</a>):
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\Theta^\prime(t) = \sum_k a_k(t) \Theta^\prime_k
\label{eigs}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(a_k(t)\)</span> is the amount of that each eigenvector <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime_k\)</span>
contributes to the total perturbation <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime_k(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Substituting equation \eqref{eigs} into \eqref{matrix}, we get
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\sum_k \frac{d a_k}{dt} \Theta^\prime_k = 
\sum_k a_k \mathbf{A}\Theta^\prime_k = 
\sum_k a_k \lambda_k \Theta^\prime_k
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
where we have used the definition of the eigenvalues <span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\Theta^\prime_k = \lambda_k \Theta^\prime_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>The eigenvectors of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> are linearly independent,
so the components of the summation decouple,
giving us a set of independent ordinary differential equations:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{d a_k}{d t} = 
\lambda_k a_k
\label{diff_eigen}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>Equation \eqref{diff_eigen} looks very much like equation \eqref{matrix},
but with one important difference:
It is now a scalar equation for the time evolution of <span class="math">\(a_k\)</span>.
In fact, it the solution of this ordinary differential equation is among the
first that students of calculus learn to find: an exponential:</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
a_k(t) = a_k(0) e^{\lambda_k t}
\label{integrated}
\end{equation}</div>
<h2>A hunt for eigenvalues</h2>
<p>Equation \eqref{integrated} gives us the solution for the
time evolution of the perturbations of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.
Remember, our perturbation to the equilibrium solution can be written
as a combination of the eigenvectors, and we are interested in whether
the perturbation grows in time or shrinks in time.
The answer to that question all comes down to the values for the eigenvalues <span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span>.
Broadly speaking, there are three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> is negative. In this case, a perturbation of the shape of <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime_k\)</span>
will shrink in time, since \eqref{integrated} is a negative exponential.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> is positive. In this case, a perturbation of the shape of <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime_k\)</span>
will grow in time, since \eqref{integrated} is a positive exponential.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> is complex. In this case, a perturbation of the shape of <span class="math">\(\Theta^\prime_k\)</span>
will have combined behaviors: it will oscillate according to the imaginary part
of <span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> (due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula">Euler's formula</a>),
and either shrink or grow according to the sign of the real part.
For our purposes, we want to know it shrinks or grows,
so we are most interested in the real part of any complex eigenvalues.</li>
</ol>
<p>In physical systems, there is always a certain amount of noise,
and in general that noise will put some amount of power
into each of the eigenvectors of the system.
Some eigenvectors might get a bit more power, some might get a bit less,
but for random, uncorrelated noise, we expect all the eigenvectors to get some.
This means that if <em>just one</em> eigenvalue has a positive real part,
then the power in that eigenvalue will blow up.
Therefore our stability metric is this: <em>all</em> of the eigenvalues must have
negative real parts for the system to be considered stable to perturbations.</p>
<p>So let's find the eigenvalues of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.
Usually calculating the eigenvalues of a matrix of a larger order than 2 or 3
is a pretty involved process, but in this case the matrix is
ordered enough, and has enough zeroes in it, that we can come up
with a closed-form solution.</p>
<p>The eigenvalues of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> can be found by solving its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial">characteristic polynomial</a>,
found by taking the determinant of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
det(\mathbf{A - \lambda \mathbf{I}}) = 
(v_0 \gamma)^N 
\begin{vmatrix}
1-\lambda &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1-\lambda &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1-\lambda &amp; -1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 1-\lambda\\
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>We apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_expansion">Laplace expansion</a>
(where I have elided some steps):
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 
(v_0 \gamma)^N \left[ (1-\lambda)^N + (-1)(-1)^{N+1}(-1)^{N-1} \right] = 0
\end{equation}</div>
<p>which may be simplified to</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
(1-\lambda)^N = 1
\end{equation}</div>
<p>Now, this polynomial equation of order <span class="math">\(N\)</span> has a fairly straightforward set
of solutions for <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>: they are the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity">roots of unity</a>,
shifted along the positive <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis by one.</p>
<p>We can write the solution for <span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> explicitly
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\lambda_k = e^{\frac{2 k \pi i}{N}} + 1 = \cos \frac{2 k \pi}{N} + i \sin \frac{2 k \pi}{N} + 1
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
which, when plotted (for <span class="math">\(N=10\)</span>), gives the following:</p>
<p><img alt="roots_of_unity" src="articles/transit/images/roots_of_unity.png" title="Eigenvalues of the stability problem"></p>
<p>Hey, look at that! The real part of each eigenvalue is greater than zero!<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
That is to say, not only is the system unstable, it is <em>wildly</em> unstable.
Remember, the system is unstable if if <em>just one</em> of the eigenvalues has a positive real part.</p>
<h2>Simulating bus bunching</h2>
<p>That was a long way to go,
but by determining that the eigenvalues of the system of equations \eqref{perturb}
all have nonnegative real parts, we determined that any perturbation
to our equilibrium solution is unstable.
Therefore, if any of the buses on our bus route get slightly off schedule,
they will continue to get further and further off schedule.</p>
<p>Let's close out the article with some interactive simulations of bus bunching.
The simulations start with a number of buses in the equilibrium configuration,
but as you will see, they soon drift away from that equilibrium, and once they
start to drift, bunching is inevitable.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the simulation: one in the <span class="math">\(v_e\)</span> reference frame,
where we see the velocities of the buses relative to their equilibrium velocity,
and one in the street frame, where we see the velocities of the buses relative to the road.</p>
<p>In the <span class="math">\(v_e\)</span> reference frame:</p>
<iframe src=/visualization/bus/bus-bunching.html?interactive=true&equilibrium=false&boost=true&gamma=0.15&n=5 width=700 height=700></iframe>

<p>In the street reference frame:</p>
<iframe src=/visualization/bus/bus-bunching.html?interactive=true&equilibrium=false&boost=false&gamma=0.15&n=5 width=700 height=700></iframe>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The model we analyzed here was probably about as simple as it could be
while still exhibiting bunching behavior. We used a simplified geometry,
and it really only had two parameters (<span class="math">\(v_0\)</span>, the speed in the absence of passengers,
and <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, the amount by which passenger boarding slows it down).
Nevertheless, it demonstrates a plausible mechanism for an all-too familiar
occurrence for transit riders.</p>
<p>The good news is that actual bus system behavior can be more complex than this
simple model: it has drivers, schedulers, and real-time information.
It is possible to design things to mitigate the essential bunchiness of a route.
Things like <a href="https://thesource.metro.net/2017/10/14/all-door-boarding-proposed-for-720-and-754-rapid-lines/">streamlined passenger boarding</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_priority">signal priority</a>,
and layovers all likely have a role in mitigating bunching.</p>
<p>So what's the moral here? I'd like to say that you shouldn't feel frustrated
the next time a pack of buses roll up to your stop, but that's probably not realistic.
Instead, maybe just look at them with grim recognition.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, there is a single eigenvalue that is equal to zero, 
when <span class="math">\(k=N\)</span>. You can verify manually that this corresponds to an eigenvector
where each bus is perturbed by the same amount (a <span class="math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> vector).
A perturbation of this form is marginally stable (neither stable nor unstable),
since none of the buses get any closer to or further from each other.
For the pedantic, you can replace of my statements about all eigenvegors 
being unstable with "all eigenvectors but one are unstable".&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
