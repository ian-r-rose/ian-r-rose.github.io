Interactive investigations into planetary interiors

Many processes in Earth science are difficult to observe or visualize due to the large timescales and lengthscales over which they operate.
The dynamics of planetary mantles are particularly challenging as we cannot even look at the rocks involved.
As a result, much teaching material on mantle dynamics relies on static images and cartoons, many of which are decades old.
Recent improvements in computing power and technology (largely driven by game and web development) have allowed for advances in
real-time physics simulations and visualizations, but these have been slow to affect Earth science education.

Here I demonstrate a teaching tool for mantle convection and seismology which solves the equations for conservation of mass, 
momentum, and energy in real time, allowing users make changes to the simulation and immediately see the effects.
The user can ask and answer questions about what happens when they add heat in one place, or take it away from another place,
or increase the temperature at the base of the mantle. They can also pause the simulation, and 
while it is paused, create and visualize seismic waves traveling through the mantle. These allow for investigations into and 
discussions about plate tectonics, earthquakes, hot spot volcanism, and planetary cooling.

The simulation is rendered to the screen using OpenGL, and is cross-platform.
It can be run as a native application for maximum performance, but it can also be embedded in a web browser for easy deployment and portability.
